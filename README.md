# kirana-data-system
This repo is meant to track my progress towards an ambitious project to achieve Data Analyst and Machine Learning skills to launch my kirana store optimization project.

# Kirana Data System

A complete data pipeline & dashboard for small retail analytics.

This project is part of my Operation Data Titan â€” a personal mission to master Python, Pandas, SQL, and dashboarding by building a real-world data system for Kirana (local retail) stores.

It aims to simulate how a small business can collect, clean, process, and visualize its sales data to make smarter daily decisions.

# ðŸš€ Project Goals

Build a clean and automated data pipeline (ETL)

Store structured data in SQLite / PostgreSQL

Perform data wrangling and analysis with Pandas & NumPy

Create visualizations using Matplotlib / Seaborn

Develop an interactive Streamlit dashboard to monitor sales metrics
